# Transpiling solidity smart contract with Sol2ink

Probably you heard about [advantages WASM smart contracts](https://use.ink/why-webassembly-for-smart-contracts) 
and if you are working with EVM you may be interested in how to rewrite your project written with solidity 
to Rust and ink!

### Installation
First what you need is, of course, [Sol2ink](/docs/Sol2ink) tool. You can use binary from release.
Move that file to folder that contains solidity smart contract and use `./sol2ink Contract.sol` command. 
Or you can clone [repository](https://github.com/Brushfam/sol2ink) and work inside Sol2ink project. We will work in this way.

### Transpiling

Take a look on code below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;


contract Owner {

    address private owner;

    event OwnerSet(address indexed oldOwner, address indexed newOwner);

    constructor() {
        console.log("Owner contract deployed by:", msg.sender);
        owner = msg.sender; 
        emit OwnerSet(address(0), owner);
    }

    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        emit OwnerSet(owner, newOwner);
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    function getOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return owner;
    }
} 
```

It's simple solidity contract that stores owner's address, allows to change this address and return it.
To transpile it, we need to run a command

```shell
cargo +nightly run Contract.sol
```

After this, you can see that `generated` folder has been created. Here you can find `contract`
and `src` folder. More about structure you can read [here](/docs/Sol2ink/capabilities).

### Add new logic

If you want to add extra functionality to your generated project, you need go to `src` folder and
work with `traits` and `impls` folders. Let's add to our contract function for reset owner role. 
It will set `owner` to zero address and will emit event after. In `traits/contract.rs` you
have trait definition. We can declare new method here:

```rust
#[openbrush::trait_definition]
pub trait Owner {
    #[ink(message)]
    fn change_owner(&mut self, new_owner: AccountId) -> Result<(), Error>;

    #[ink(message)]
    fn get_owner(&self) -> Result<AccountId, Error>;

    // new method
    #[ink(message)]
    fn renounce_ownership(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error>;
}
```

We need use `mut` because we will change storage value `owner`. Also, this function have
[message attribute](https://use.ink/macros-attributes/message) as it's public.

Our next step is to write implementation for this function and for renounce event. For it we
need to change trait implementation in `impls/contract.rs` and add this function:

```rust
fn renounce_ownership(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        let old_owner = self.data().owner.clone();
        self.data().owner = ZERO_ADDRESS.into();
        self._emit_renounce_ownership_event(old_owner);
        Ok(())
    }
```

For now `_emit_renounce_ownership_event` doesn't exist, so let's create it. You can see that
`impls/contract.rs` have one more trait implementation. We use `Internal` trait for
event declaration. Final `Internal` trait code will have default event implementation:

```rust
pub trait Internal {
    fn _emit_owner_set(&self, old_owner: AccountId, new_owner: AccountId);

    fn _emit_renounce_ownership_event(&self, old_owner: AccountId);

}

impl<T: Storage<Data>> Internal for T {
    default fn _emit_owner_set(&self, _: AccountId, _: AccountId) {}

    default fn _emit_renounce_ownership_event(&self, _: AccountId) {}
}
```

If you want to override event default behavior, you can open `contracts/contract/lib.rs`
and add some logic in `Internal` implementation for `Contract`:

```rust
fn _emit_renounce_ownership_event(&self, old_owner: AccountId) {
    self.env().emit_event(ContractSet {
        old_owner,
        ZERO_ADDRESS,
    });
}
```

Weâ€™re done! Now you know how to transpile contracts with Sol2ink, what project structure it uses
and how work with project after transpiling.
